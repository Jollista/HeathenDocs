## Organization
- **Deprecated** contains outdated docs. They're kept here rather than deleted in case we need them for some reason later. If a feature is deprecated, please move all related docs to the Deprecated folder.
- **Assets** is a disorganized collection of images and other sorts of files that are displayed on certain articles.
- **Meeting Notes** is a collection of notes from meetings, which may discuss goals, obstacles, current progress, division of labor, design proposals, etc.
- **Story** contains any article that relates to the narrative side of the game (such as a setting bible, plot summary, character profiles, etc.). It **does not** contain (but may reference) any sort of mechanics whatsoever.
- **Style** contains the style guide and is intended to be used as a resource for artists to be on the same page when contributing art towards the game.
- **Systems** contains all articles pertaining to mechanical systems, such as the player controller, class hierarchy, enemy designs, etc.
