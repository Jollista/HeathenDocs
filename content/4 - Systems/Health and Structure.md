There are two types of damage in Heathen: [[Health and Structure#Health|Health]] and [[Health and Structure#Structure|Structure]].
# Health
Health is representative of a [[Creature]]'s life. When a Creature has zero or less Health, it is [[Health and Structure#Dead|Dead]].
# Structure
Structure is representative of a [[Creature]]'s poise in battle. When a creature has zero or less Structure, it is [[Health and Structure#Staggered|Staggered]].
# Invincible
Invincible [[Creature|Creatures]] ignore all damage received.
# Dead
A [[Creature]]'s [[StateMachine]] determines what behavior it exhibits when it is Dead (typically removal from the scene).
# Staggered
A [[Creature]]'s [[StateMachine]] determines what behavior it exhibits when it is Staggered.
